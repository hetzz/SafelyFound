<h3 align="center">Providing help to locate missing children via face recognition</h3>



------------------------------------------

> **174**. That is the average number of children that go missing every day in India. 2 out of 3 missing children are untraced in a period of three years and about half are never found. The wait for them is an excrutiaing see-saw of agony and hope for their loved ones.

> For our OOPM Project, we have made an application that uses facial recognition to help locate missing children in India.
